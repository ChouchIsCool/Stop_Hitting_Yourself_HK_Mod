https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKz5hYtjXKEppj9Y_SbXTOQ youtube too, but it's mostly mkw modding -> yes this is a shameless self promo B)


A simple mod made to see if I could make a mod for this game without much difficulty. I'm grateful that the process is well documented enough to easily get into.
